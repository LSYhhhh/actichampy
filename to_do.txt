- x-axis ticks & labels
- y-axis ticks & labels
- amplitude-color-coded y-axis labels
- frequency domain side-graphic
	- might need to restrict the samples_per_screen to powers of 2 to make the frequency-domain graphic accurate
- set # of channels
- scroll channels
- try better bandpass filter (scipy.signal.firwin)
